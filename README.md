Files supporting the development of subseasonal to seasonal forecasts for dengue virus in four cities across Colombia. 
Details about this work can be found in Forecasting Dengue: Evaluating the Role of Hydroclimate Information in Subseasonal to Seasonal Prediction

VBDSimple runs functions from VBDFunctions that pulls dengue incidence, climate, and hydrology data to build random forest models for dengue virus predictions
at 1-, 3-, and 6-month lead times.

The Dengue virus data cannot be shared over Github.
